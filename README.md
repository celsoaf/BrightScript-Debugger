# BrightScript-Debugger

BrigthScript is a programming language based on JavaScript and Visual Basic, created by Roku. Roku is a company who produces and commercializes devices that are used to watch movies and television. These devices are usually connected to a TV and are commonly known as TV boxes. BrightScript is the language on which applications for their boxes are developed. 
After some analysis, we could not found many development tools and the existing ones are not functional enough. Roku provides an Eclipse plugin and the boxes expose a telnet port for basic debugging. The Eclipse plugin itself only makes syntax validation and deploys the application code to the box. There are several open source plugins for the most popular text editors that perform syntax highlighting.
The goal of this project is therefore to implement an integrated tool for application development thereby simplifying the development process, that includes debugging. This tool supports syntax validation, code compilation, intellisense and graphical debug interaction. 
Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment created by Microsoft and it is the main tool for the development of Windows applications. The tool is materialized as a Visual Studio plugin for the BrightScript language. This plugin uses the language services provided by Visual Studio SDK.
